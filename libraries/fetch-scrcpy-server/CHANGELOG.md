# Change Log - @yume-chan/fetch-scrcpy-server

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 53688d3: Use PNPM workspace and Changesets to manage the monorepo.

    Because Changesets doesn't support alpha versions (`0.x.x`), this version is `1.0.0`. Future versions will follow SemVer rules, for example, breaking API changes will introduce a new major version.

- ea5002b: Mark `BIN` field as pure
