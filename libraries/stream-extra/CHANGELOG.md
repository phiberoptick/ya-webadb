## 0.0.24

Tue, 18 Jun 2024 02:49:43 GMT

### Updates

- Add `MaybeConsumable` type. It's also a namespace containing related types.
- Re-export global `TextDecoderStream` to replace `DecodeUtf8Stream` which doesn't work correctly in stream mode
- Move `Consumable` related types to the `Consumable` namespace. In future, more types will be moved to namespaces.

### Updates

- Fix `ConsumableWritableStream.write` calls `chunk.consume` twice. (doesn't cause any issue)
- Fix `WrapWritableStream` might close the inner stream twice. (and throw an error)
- Remove web-streams-polyfill dependency. The runtime must have global stream implementations (or you can add a polyfill yourself).
